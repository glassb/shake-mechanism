# Artificial Shake Mechanism -
# For Freefly MōVI Pro by Arduino Microcontroller

With camera movement, cinematographers seek for complete control. Even in the case of camera shake, this is true. Whether a filmmaker attempts to capture the small jitters from an earthquake rumbling a building, the flux of a car moving fast over bumpy terrain, or the slow weaves and jostles that are characteristic of a camera handheld, these frame motions needs to be deliberate. With machinery, we have the ability to pinpoint the frame motion we desire, eliminating the human element – and likely the associated error.  

I developed a mechanism that adds artificial shake to a camera frame. I programed an Arduino microcontroller to control a MōVI Pro’s gimbal motors through the Gimbal Control Unit. The Arduino sends commands that change the motors rotational velocity, manifesting as jerky camera motion. 

The Arduino code is available here.

Download the Freefly API here: http://freeflysystems.com/support/movi-pro-support and install the API files a library in the Arduino Web Editor. Include in the Arduino code file.
