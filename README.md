# Artificial Shake Mechanism -
# For Freefly MōVI Pro by Arduino Microcontroller

With camera movement, cinematographers seek for complete control. Even in the case of camera shake, this is true. Whether a filmmaker attempts to capture the small jitters from an earthquake rumbling a building, the flux of a car moving fast over bumpy terrain, or the slow weaves and jostles that are characteristic of a camera handheld, these frame motions needs to be deliberate. With machinery, we have the ability to pinpoint the frame motion we desire, eliminating the human element – and likely the associated error.  

I developed a mechanism that adds artificial shake to a camera frame. I programed an Arduino microcontroller to control a MōVI Pro’s gimbal motors through the Gimbal Control Unit. The Arduino sends commands that change the motors rotational velocity, manifesting as jerky camera motion. 

The Arduino code is available here.
