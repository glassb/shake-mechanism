# Artificial Shake Mechanism - For Freefly MōVI Pro by Arduino Microcontroller

With camera movement, cinematographers seek complete control. Even in the case of camera shake, this is true. Whether a filmmaker attempts to capture the small jitters from an earthquake rumbling a building, the jostling of a car moving fast over bumpy terrain, or the slow weaves that are characteristic of a camera handheld, these frame motions need to be deliberate. With machinery, we have the ability to pinpoint the frame motion we desire, eliminating the human element – and the likely associated error.

An Arduino Esplora microcontroller controls a MōVI Pro’s gimbal motors through the Gimbal Control Unit. The Arduino sends commands that change the motors rotational velocity, that result in jerky camera motion.

Windy Films treats this project as a proof of concept. Although the mechanism is functional and expandable, the hardware limitations and lack of time for production lead us to look to others for further development. By making the software available and presenting the hardware configuration, our hope is that this mechanism appears as a widely useful feature that can be integrated easily into an existing environment, including the Freefly MōVI Pro. As a motion feature incorporated into the MōVI environment, the shake mechanism would be (a) developed more extensively, and (b) the mechanism would be more easily operated.
